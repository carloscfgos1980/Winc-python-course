Exercise: Modules

wincpy start 78029e0e504a49e5b16482a7a23af58c

This is going to be an exercise in importing modules, reading the documentation about them, and using them. These are important skills to have, so we try here not to give too much away. Don't worry about it if it takes you a little bit of time -- stay calm and use your Google-foo!

At the top of your main.py, import a module that prints the Zen of Python.
Write a function wait that takes one argument -- seconds (int) -- that uses a function in the time module to make the computer wait for that number of seconds, then returns nothing.
Implement a function my_sin that takes one float as an argument and returns the sine of that float. Use the math module.
Implement a function iso_now that takes no arguments and returns a string containing the current date and time up to the minute in the ISO 8601 format. Example: 2000-12-31T17:00. Use the datetime module.
Implement a function platform that takes no arguments and returns a string that shows which platform (Linux, Windows, macOS, and so on) we are on. Use the sys module.
Create a new file greet.py, and in that file implement a function supergreeting that takes a name as an argument (str) and returns a string of the form 'Hellooo...ooo, Bob!'. Then import this function in main.py and write a function supergreeting_wrapper that takes the exact same type of argument, calls supergreeting with it and returns the result.
