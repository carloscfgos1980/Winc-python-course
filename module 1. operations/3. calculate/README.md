We're in a supermarket and we need to calculate some prices. Naturally we grab our laptop and start writing a Python script.

Create a variable for each of the following items in the supermarket: broccoli, leek, potato and brussel_sprout. Broccoli and leek are 2 euros a piece, a potato is 3 euros and a Brussels sprout will set you back 7 euros. Times are hard.
Calculate the total cost if you were to buy one of each -- not by hand, of course, let Python do it! Store this in a variable sum_one_each.
Calculate the average price per item and store this in avg_price.
Create a variable num_potatoes that indicates we want 7 potatoes. Do the same for:
num_broccolis -- we want 5 of those.
num_leeks -- 2 please.
num_brussel_sprouts -- we'll take 10.
Calculate the sum total and store it in a variable aptly named sum_total.
Fortunately for us, there's a discount of 30%. Store this in a variable discount_percentage (hint: note the variable name already says 'percent')
Calculate the amount owed after the discount is applied, rounded to the nearest cent. Store the result in discounted_sum_total.
Print this amount.
