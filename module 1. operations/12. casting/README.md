wincpy start 62311a1767294e058dc13c953e8690a4

Part 1

Create a variable leek_price with an integer value of 2.
Cast this into a string and use the +-operator to print a string like this one, only with the correct price in it:
'Leek is 50 euro per kilo.'
Part 2

We got an order for four leeks! Store the string 'leek 4' in a variable.
Use find and slicing to extract the number from this string.
Cast it into an integer.
Use this and leek_price to compute the sum total and store it in sum_total. Print out the value for this variable.
Part 3

Broccoli costs 2.34 euros per kg. We got an order: 'broccoli 1.6'.

Create one variable for the broccoli price and one for the order.
Compute the total price for this order.
Use the +-operator to assemble and print a string that looks like the following:
'1.6kg broccoli costs 500.34e'
Tip

You can use round(number, 2) to round number to 2 decimal places.
