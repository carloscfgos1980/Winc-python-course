Now how does this work exactly, you might ask?

We supply the name of the function we want to use: print.
We call (execute) this function using parentheses: print().
Finally, we supply the function with an argument in between the parentheses. In the above example we give it a piece of text as an argument: 'Hello
world'.
A piece of text is known as a string, which we indicate by surrounding it with apostrophes: 'Some text'
We can supply print with other arguments in order to print whatever we want! Print accepts lots of different things as arguments: strings, but also numbers, and more.

We can even give it multiple arguments, in order to print multiple things. Here's some examples of using the print function to print text and numbers:
