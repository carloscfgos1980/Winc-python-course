One of the most common datatypes to many programming languages is the string, which can contain sequences of characters. In Python the string is called str. You can declare it using single ('), double (") and triple double quotes.

example_one = 'I am a string.'
example_two = "Me too!"
example_three = """I too am a string.
                   I am, in fact, a multiline string!"""

'''What if the string itself should contain quotation marks? Here's how you do that:'''

example_one = 'I\'m a string.'
example_two = "I'm a string."
example_three = 'He said: "I\'m a string"'
