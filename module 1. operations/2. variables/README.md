## Exercise:

Create 3 variables with 3 different types of things in them:

A "string", for example: 'This is an example of a string.'
An "integer" (a simple number), for example: 3 or 9999.
A "boolean", for example: True or False
Use wincpy check to see if you've completed the exercise succesfully.

# Variables and datatypes

So now you can create variables with different kinds of values in them. In programming terminology we say that a value has a "datatype". What this means exactly we'll learn a little later. For now it's enough to know that we can put different kinds of values in variables.

For example: we can put different kinds of numbers into variables. The two main categories are:

integers -- these are whole numbers like 3 and 182
floats -- decimal numbers like 3.14 and 182.03

# Names for variables

When thinking of a name for a variable there are certain technical limitations. Read the linked part of this page on the technical limitations on variable name

https://realpython.com/python-variables/#variable-names

At the same time there are also some do's and don'ts when creating a new variable name. The most important rule here is:

Important

The name of a variable should accurately communicate what the variable contains.

Do's:

communicate what the variable contains
if there's more than one "thing" in the variable use plural form (players instead of player)
use as many words as necessary (and not more)
change a variable name later on when you think of a better name
Don'ts:

single letter variables (there are one or two exceptions to this)
unclear abbreviations (student_grade_average vs std_grd_avg)
put the type of the variable in the name (so no int_number_of_students)
use more words than necessary (the_average_grade_of_this_student vs student_grade_average)
