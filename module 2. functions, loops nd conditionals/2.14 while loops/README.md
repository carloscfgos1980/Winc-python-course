While Loops

One type of loop is the while loop. It keeps looping until the specified condition is no longer true or break-statement has been reached.

Try out these two loops:

# Hit control + c on your keyboard to unstuck from this :-)
while True:
    print('Woop woop, an infinite loop.')

i = 10
while i > 0:
    print(i)
    i -= 1
